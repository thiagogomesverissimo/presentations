\begin{frame}{Introduction}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Universities have multiple organizational levels, including:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Departments, research groups, student organizations.
            \item Administrative units, postgraduate programs, laboratories.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Each level requires a dedicated online presence.
        \item Traditional solutions impose a high maintenance burden on users and IT teams.
    \end{itemize}
