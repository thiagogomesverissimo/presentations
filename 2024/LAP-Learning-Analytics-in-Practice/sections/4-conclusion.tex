\section{Conclusion}

\begin{frame}{Conclusion}
    This is a work-in-progress project where we propose to place students in the role of 
    decision-makers to gather insights from prediction models. 
    \\
    Moreover, students will decide what data should be included or excluded from the model.
    \\
    This approach involves addressing several software engineering issues.

    \begin{table}[]
        \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|} \hline
                 & Can choose Features?  & Can see Predictions?                    \\ \hline
         Student & \textcolor{red}{Yes}  & \textcolor{red}{Yes}                    \\ \hline
         Teacher & No                    & \textcolor{blue}{Maybe} (student decides) \\ \hline
         Manager & No                    & \textcolor{blue}{Maybe} (student decides) \\ \hline
        \end{tabular}
