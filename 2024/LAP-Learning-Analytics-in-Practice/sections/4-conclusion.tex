\section{Conclusion}

\begin{frame}{Conclusion}
    This is a work-in-progress project where we propose to place students in the role of 
    decision-makers to gather insights from prediction models. 
    Moreover, students will decide what data should be included or excluded from the model. 
    This approach involves addressing several software engineering issues.
