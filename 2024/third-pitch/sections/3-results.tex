\begin{frame}{Tertiary Literature Review}
    From the 189 articles found, 15 were selected. These were categorized as follows: 6 evaluated educational foundations, 6 did not use specific criteria in the review, 2 verified articles validating dashboard application, and only 1 evaluated whether EPs utilized machine learning mechanisms.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Tertiary Literature Review - Results}
    No review considered dashboards in Moodle LMS, and more broadly, none considered implementations in open-source code.

\begin{frame}{Qualification}
    Our next step, up to \underline{qualification by the end of 2024}, will be to conduct a systematic review focusing on primary articles that have developed dashboards within the Moodle environment, with particular attention to the following aspects: 
    
    \begin{enumerate}[<alert@+>]\color{gray}
        \item Use of machine learning in dashboards (and raising software engineering issues related to this)
        \item Whether the code is available or not
    \end{enumerate}
