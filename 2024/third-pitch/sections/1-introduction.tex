\section{Introduction}

\begin{frame}{Context}
    Our aim is to study, scientifically, the construction of Learning Analytics Dashboards and related software engineering issues.

    It is a Learning Analytics research field \cite{lang2017handbook}.

\begin{frame}{Advances since last pitch - July 2023}
    \begin{itemize}[<alert@+>]\color{gray}
        \item All credits class, in theory and systems, have been completed
        \item PAE assistant (monitor) in MAC0110 
        \item An extended abstract was accepted and published in \textbf{Frontiers in Education 2023}
        \item I presented my work-in-progress project at \textbf{Learning Analytics in Practice 2024}
        \item I performed a Tertiary Literature Review (will be presented)
    \end{itemize}

\subsection{Research Questions}
\begin{frame}{Research Questions (temporary yet)}
    \begin{enumerate}[<+-|alert@+>]\color{gray}
        \item What kind of external data can be usefully and safely integrated with 
              the Moodle (behavioral) data?
        \item How this enriched data can be used as features for Statistical and 
              Machine Learning models (to be presented in dashboards) respecting privacy and student autonomy?
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Our proposal}
    The traditional approach used to build dashboards (we are currently confirming through a Systematic Literature Review):

    \begin{table}[]
        \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|} \hline
                 & Can choose Features? & Can see Predictions?\\ \hline
         Student & No                   & No                  \\ \hline
         Teacher & No                   & Yes                 \\ \hline
         Manager & Yes                  & Yes                 \\ \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \end{table}

    Our proposal: Student \underline{in Control} Perspective
    \pause
    \begin{table}[]
        \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|} \hline
                 & Can choose Features?  & Can see Predictions?                    \\ \hline
         Student & \textcolor{red}{Yes}  & \textcolor{red}{Yes}                    \\ \hline
         Teacher & No                    & \textcolor{blue}{Maybe} (student decides) \\ \hline
         Manager & No                    & \textcolor{blue}{Maybe} (student decides) \\ \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \end{table}

        \end{minipage}
    \end{figure}

    \begin{itemize}[<+-|alert@+>]\color{gray}
        \item The Moodle Analytics API is designed primarily for teachers and managers, so a lot of 
              work is needed on plugins to empower students with similar capabilities
        \item The possibility for each student to choose their own data requires 
              rebuilding the model many times, which can impact performance
    \end{itemize}
